# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose

This goal of this project was to perform API searches on locations that would provide weather and hotel information. 
This information would be used to help develop an itinerary for potential travelers to determine the ideal location for their trip as well as provide lodging and transportation information. 

## Analysis

Using a list of randomly generated latitudes and longitudes, I performed an API call to find weather information pertaining to the cities nearest to the marker points (Latitude, Longitude, Max Temperature, % Humidity, % Cloudiness, Wind Speed, Weather Description)


In the Vacation_Search folder I customized a map of preferred travel destinations based on user input of Maximum Temperature and included nearby hotel information.

In the Vacation_Itinerary folder, I chose four nearby cities to create an itinerary that showed directions from city to city.
